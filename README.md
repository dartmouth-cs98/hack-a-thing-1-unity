# Roll a Ball Modification

## Summary
This project is a small modification of Unity's Roll-a-Ball tutorial. I also did a few smaller Unity lessons and tutorials, but they weren't really big enough to add to the repo. 
The user attempts to reach the goal in the shortest amount of time and with the highest number of points. Don't fall off! 
## What I learned:
* I previously had a strong resentment towards Unity due to some unfortunate conclusions to DALI projects. However, it's growing on me-- I'm not used to C#, but the overall workflow makes sense.

## What didn't work
* Honestly, I wish I had more time to work on this. I had so many ideas I wanted to try in Unity-- once I started using the platform, the ball really got rolling! (No pun intended). 
I wrote them all down in my notebook, in the event that I have more time in the future.
